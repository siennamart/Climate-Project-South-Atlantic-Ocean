# Climate-Project-South-Atlantic-Ocean
This porject will look into predicting the surface temperature of the South Atlantic Ocean using data from the past 80 years. Specifically, we will be predicting the surface temperatures 4 years into the future. 
# Source
This data can be found on the class repository: https://github.com/galenegan/DATA-3320/tree/main/climate and is open sourced from ERA 5: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview
# Data Analysis
The data analysis can be found on GitHub as in named . In order to predict the surface temperatures we will be conducting a lagged regression and a auto regression of our data. Before doing this we will filter our data to make sure no incorrect dates are chosen and also make sure that are variables/ values are correct.
